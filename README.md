This project now consists out of two parts.

1. The 3D simulation/interface of the Robotic Arm.
2. The Arduino robotic-arm project (which is compatible with the 3D interface).

# Robot Simulation
Robotic arm simulation and control in Processing - Initial code by: CoreTech Robotics

# Arduino Robot
Robotic servo arm controlled by Arduino.




## TODO list

### Arduino
- Build the Arduino robot
- Program the Arduino robot

### Processing
- Physics
- - pick-up-able blocks.
- Serial communication (to arduino-robot?)
- User interface
- - Dragging parts of the robot
- - Recording/replaying motion
- - Console window
